# Travel Time Example

This example is meant to guide an implementation of fetching travel time from the UrbanLogiq system.

## Getting started

1. Ensure that Java 21 or higher is installed
2. Ensure that Maven is installed
3. Ensure that the UrbanLogiq SDK (available [here](https://github.com/urbanlogiq/ulsdk)) is available from your local Maven repository.
4. Create an executable jar file using Maven:
```
mvn package
```
5. Run the jar file (take note of the filename, which is static):
```
java -jar ./target/TravelTimeExample-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
